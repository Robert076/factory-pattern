# 🌎 factory-pattern
Practicing the factory design pattern. A useful example in python too.

The factory example is useful in cases that sound like this:

`I want a <object> but I can't be bothered to know how it is made`

That is where factory comes into play.

You just create a factory object which you define, and in that factory class you define methods to create specific objects you want, and just call those methods. Boom! No more wasting time trying to understand the code-behind.

> ❗️ Do keep in mind that in some cases you might not want this as you can't know what's hardcoded behind in those creational methods.
